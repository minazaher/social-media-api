# Project: GraphQL API with JWT Authentication

## Overview
This project is a GraphQL API built using Node.js, Express.js, and GraphQL. It focuses on efficient data handling and secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). MongoDB CRUD operations are managed with Mongoose.

## Features
- Built a robust API with Node.js, Express.js, and GraphQL.
- Implemented JWT authentication for secure access to endpoints.
- Utilized Mongoose for MongoDB CRUD operations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/graphql-api.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
- The API can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Use GraphQL queries and mutations to interact with the API.
- Authentication is required for certain endpoints. Include a valid JWT token in the request headers.
